The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason. **ConVE** includes three subtasks that require models to acquire and apply commonsense knowledge. In this notebook you will focus on **SubTask B**:\n","\n","- Given a statement that does not make sense and three possible reasons, select which reason explains why the given statement is against common sense. For example, for the following nonsensical statement the correct answer is *Reason A*:\n","\n","     *Statement*: He put an elephant into the fridge.  \n","     *Reason A*: An elephant is much bigger than a fridge.  \n","     *Reason B*: Elephants are usually white while fridges are usually white.  \n","     *Reason C*: An elephant cannot eat a fridge.\n","     \n","     This subtask can be approached as a Multiple Choice problem where the input is the nonsensical statement and the three possible explanations, and the output is a label indicating which of the reasons is the correct one.\n","\n","You will fine-tune a Pre-trained Language Model with [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library that provides a set of tools for fine-tunning and deploying a wide variety of Pre-trained Language Models.

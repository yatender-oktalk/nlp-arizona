The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason. **ConVE** includes three subtasks that require models to acquire and apply commonsense knowledge. In this notebook you will focus on **SubTask A**:\n","\n","- Given two similar statements that differ by only a few words, select the statement of the two that does not make sense. For example, within the statements below, *Statement 2* is the nonsensical statement:\n","\n","     *Statement 1*: He put a turkey into the fridge.    \n","     *Statement 2*: He put an elephant into the fridge.\n","     \n","     This subtask can be approached as a Text Matching problem where the input is the two statements and the output is a label indicating which is the nonsensical one.\n","\n","You will fine-tune a Pre-trained Language Model with [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library that provides a set of tools for fine-tunning and deploying a wide variety of Pre-trained Language Models.

The training is highly customizable through a wide range of options and hyperparameters that are handled by the [TrainingArguments](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.27.2/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments) class. Your next goal is to create both the `TrainingArguments` and `Trainer` objects that will be used to fine-tune **RoBERTa**.

This function takes as arguments the `epochs`, `train_batch_size` and `learning_rate` hyperparameters along with the `output_dir`.

During the training, the model must be evaluated on the development test after every epoch. `TrainingArguments` should include this strategy.\n","\n","> **Important!** By default, `Trainer` saves a checkpoint of the model every 500 training steps.

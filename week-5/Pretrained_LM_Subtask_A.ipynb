The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason. **ConVE** includes three subtasks that require models to acquire and apply commonsense knowledge. In this notebook you will focus on **SubTask A**:\n","\n","- Given two similar statements that differ by only a few words, select the statement of the two that does not make sense. For example, within the statements below, *Statement 2* is the nonsensical statement:\n","\n","     *Statement 1*: He put a turkey into the fridge.    \n","     *Statement 2*: He put an elephant into the fridge.\n","     \n","     This subtask can be approached as a Text Matching problem where the input is the two statements and the output is a label indicating which is the nonsensical one.\n","\n","You will fine-tune a Pre-trained Language Model with [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library that provides a set of tools for fine-tunning and deploying a wide variety of Pre-trained Language Models.

The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason. **ConVE** includes three subtasks that require models to acquire and apply commonsense knowledge. In this notebook you will focus on **SubTask C**:\n","\n","- Given a statement that does not make sense, generate the reason why this statement does not make sense.

However, it should be noted that the test sets in the two cases are different. More importantly, these results are indicative of the limitations of metrics such as *bleu* and *rouge* for evaluating text generation. Take, for example, the following case from the test set:\n","\n","\n","| FalseSent                 | reason1                                        | reason2                          | reason3                         |\n","|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------|\n","| Beer that is drunk by humans is white | Beer is made of barley and it is a yellow drink | A beer that is drunk by humans is not white. | Beer is brown |\n","\n","The predictions obtained by the partial and full trainings and their corresponding scores are the following:\n","\n","| full training    | prediction                 | bleu     | rouge    |\n","|:-----------------|:---------------------------|---------:|---------:|\n","| no               | Beer that is drunk by humans is white  | 0.731    | 0.889    |\n","| yes              | White beer is not suitable for human consumption. | 0.000    | 0.364    |\n","\n","The text generated by the full training is a better explanation than the reason generated by the partial training, which is a mere repetition of the nonsensical statement. However, the latter obtains much better scores than the former. Metrics such as *bleu* and *rouge* do not always replace accurately the human judgement."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.7"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

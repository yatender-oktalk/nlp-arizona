# Objectives

The learning objectives of this assignment are to:

1. obtain the numeric representation of neural network input and output
2. create, train and run a recurrent neural network 
3. initialize an embedding layer with pre-trained word embeddings

# Setup your environment and prepare data

First, carefully follow the *General Instructions for Programming Assignments*.

To install the libraries required for this assignment run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

or in case you work with macOS:

    pip install -r requirements-macos.txt

Download and unzip GloVe embeddings:

    wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
    unzip -d glove glove.6B.zip
